- 👋 Hi, I’m @danshil
- 👀 I’m interested in integrating new tools and technologies into healthcare, from a clinician's perspective.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css, and javascript, with a long term goal of building helpful tools for physicians.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical information technology.
- 👨‍⚕️ I'm a rural medicine generalist with a slight focus in emergency medicine, but experience in clinic, hospitalist, administration and teaching.
- 📫 I occasionally write at https://medium.com/@danshil
