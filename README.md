- 👋 Hi, I’m @danshil
- 👀 I’m interested in creating new tools and technologies for clinicians and healthcare systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, advanced css, and javascript, with a long term goal of building helpful tools for physicians.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical software development and UX.
- 👨‍⚕️ I'm a rural medicine generalist with a focus in emergency medicine, but also have experience at the clinic, as a hospitalist, as an administrator, and in teaching.
- 📫 I occasionally write at https://medium.com/@danshil
