- 👋 Hi, I’m @danshil
- 👀 I’m interested in creating new tools and technologies for clinicians and healthcare systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NodeJS, React, and Typescript with a long term goal of building helpful tools for physicians and other primary healthcare professionals. 
- 📖 I am reasonably proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and build tools (e.g. Webpack) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical software development, healthcare informatics, and UX.
- 👨‍⚕️ I'm an ER and family medicine physician with experience in hospitalist and remote/rural medicine. I also have experience in administration and clinical teaching.
- 🏋️ In my spare time (when not coding) I lift, read, and cook.
